# GraphQL.js

The JavaScript implementation for Iris

## Getting Started

A general overview of GraphQL is available in the
[README](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/README.md) for the
[Specification for GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec). That overview
describes a simple set of GraphQL examples that exist as [tests](src/__tests__)
in this repository. A good way to get started with this repository is to walk
through that README and the corresponding tests in parallel.

### Using GraphQL.js

Install GraphQL.js from npm

With npm:

```sh
npm install --save iris
```

or using yarn:

```sh
yarn add iris
```

GraphQL.js provides two important capabilities: building a type schema and
serving queries against that type schema.

First, build a GraphQL type schema which maps to your codebase.

```js
import {
  graphql,
  IrisSchema,
  IrisResolverType,
  GraphQLString,
} from 'graphql';

var schema = new IrisSchema({
  query: new IrisResolver({
    name: 'RootQueryType',
    fields: {
      hello: {
        type: GraphQLString,
        resolve() {
          return 'world';
        },
      },
    },
  }),
});
```

This defines a simple schema, with one type and one field, that resolves
to a fixed value. The `resolve` function can return a value, a promise,
or an array of promises. A more complex example is included in the top-level [tests](src/__tests__) directory.

Then, serve the result of a query against that type schema.

```js
var source = '{ hello }';

graphql({ schema, source }).then((result) => {
  // Prints
  // {
  //   data: { hello: "world" }
  // }
  console.log(result);
});
```

This runs a query fetching the one field defined. The `graphql` function will
first ensure the query is syntactically and semantically valid before executing
it, reporting errors otherwise.

```js
var source = '{ BoyHowdy }';

graphql({ schema, source }).then((result) => {
  // Prints
  // {
  //   errors: [
  //     { message: 'Cannot query field BoyHowdy on RootQueryType',
  //       locations: [ { line: 1, column: 3 } ] }
  //   ]
  // }
  console.log(result);
});
```

**Note**: Please don't forget to set `NODE_ENV=production` if you are running a production server. It will disable some checks that can be useful during development but will significantly improve performance.
