# Iris.js

Iris.js is a schema definition language for GraphLQ apis,
which provides flexibility and type safety. The schema generated by iris can be used by regular Graphql servers (Apollo, Express,..).

## Motivation

- GraphQL forces the client to select fields of types, which is not well suited for server-to-server applications (where you don't need selectivity, like in RPC) and is causing difficulties with recursive data types (like [tree types](https://github.com/iris-qraphql/iris-spec/blob/main/why-gql-needs-typed-scalars.md)).
- Default values for GraphQL inputs are dangerous for recursive data types.
- GraphQL does not support input unions
- the separation between input and output types and the use of multiple entities to cover sum and product types is not always practical and leads to a verbose schema definition.

Iris solutions.

- in Iris you can use `data` types that can be used for both input and output and do not force the client to select fields.
- default values in iris are only allowed on arguments.
- iris uses only 3 entities `wrapping`, `data` and `resolver` types. where `data` and `resolver` are represented with identical `ADT` syntax. the type `data` covers also the case of input union.

for further details see [specification](https://github.com/iris-qraphql/iris-spec).

## Getting Started

### Using Iris.js

Since Iris is not yet published in the NPM registry, a first step would be to clone the repo and run `demo`. which will execute file in `scripts/demo.ts`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iris-qraphql/iris-js

cd iris-js
npm i
npm run demo
```

### Iris Api with Apollo Server

`Iris.js` provides the capability to build an executable GraphQL schema based on the iris syntax, where the generated executable GQLSchema validates and executes the query according to the iris type definitions.

The following example demonstrates the iris scheme definition:

```graphql
"""
lifespan of deity
"""
data Lifespan
  = Immortal {}
  | Limited { max: Int? }

"""
Third and fourth generation of the deity in Greek mythology,
also called Olympians.
"""
resolver God = {
    name: String
    lifespan: Lifespan
  }

"""
A supernatural being considered divine and sacred
"""
resolver Deity
  = God
  | """
    second generation of the deity in Greek mythology
    """
    Titan { name: String }

resolver Query = {
    deities(lifespan: Lifespan?): [Deity]
  }
```

If we now use it with resolvers, we can create a GQL schema

```js
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server';
import { irisSchema } from 'iris';

const typeDefs = `<type definitions above> ...`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    deities: () => [
      {
        name: 'Iris',
        age: 12,
        __typename: 'God',
      },
      {
        name: 'Zeus',
        __typename: 'Deity_Titan',
      },
    ],
  },
  God: {
    lifespan: () => ({
      __typename: 'Limited',
      max: 200,
    }),
  },
};

const schema = irisSchema(typeDefs, { resolvers });
```

schema defined above can be used by regular GraphQL server (for example we use apollo server).

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({ schema });

server.listen().then(({ url }) => console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`));
```

GraphQL server is running on: <http://localhost:4000>.

where client will see following GraphQL schema definition.

```graphql
"""
lifespan of deity

@typedef {{ __typename: "Limited", max: ?Int }} Lifespan_Limited
@type {("Immortal" | Lifespan_Limited)}
"""
scalar Lifespan

"""
Third and fourth generation of the deity in Greek mythology,
also called Olympians.
"""
type God {
  name: String!
  lifespan: Lifespan!
}

"""
A supernatural being considered divine and sacred
"""
union Deity = God | Deity_Titan

"""
second generation of the deity in Greek mythology
"""
type Deity_Titan {
  name: String!
}

type Query {
  deities(lifespan: Lifespan): [Deity!]!
}
```

as we can see type `Lifespan` is represented as scalar. however their values will be validated accordingly to iris type definition. in addition client libraries can use its description in `JSDoc`
to generate corresponding types.

in this server, following query:

```gql
query GetDeities {
  deities {
    ... on God {
      name
      lifespan
    }
    ... on Deity_Titan {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

will return:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "deities": [
      {
        "name": "Iris",
        "lifespan": {
          "__typename": "Limited",
          "max": 200
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "Zeus"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
